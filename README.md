## Why use Josh?

The best reason to use Josh is quite simply to get a project up and running as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible when it
comes to the database interaction layer.  It does this by removing the complexity of setting up an ORM or learning a database language, while
still giving you all the power it can muster.

## When NOT to use Josh?

If you think you can do better, if you already know database interactions or ORMs, or you don't trust database wrappers made by other people...
well in any of those cases I don't even know why you're on this page, go on now, `git out --of:here` and go make some good apps, you don't need this!

## When's he coming to town?

You better watch out, you better not cry, better not pout I'm telling you why: Josh is coming to town... Soonâ„¢.
